Mission: To implement two modifiers for Windows users.
   SteamOS and Linux users can already use two modifiers.
      SteamOS: alt modifier and winkey modifier by default
      Linux: alt modifier and winkey modifier after disabling shortcuts

By using a very short ahk script, Windows users can hide the left windows key from the operating system while dota2 is the active window. This allows the winkey shortcuts to work outside of dota while allowing two modifiers to be used when playing dota.
I have bound the alt modifier to space in-game and have bound the winkey modifier to left alt using ahk.
      Windows: alt modifer and winkey modifier after running OLite.exe to disable winkey shortcuts in dota 2
      
**The only thing preventing windows users from enjoying two-modifiers is that the the winkey shorcuts "alt-tab" them out of their game.


To Install:

1. Place the OLite.exe in your StartUp folder (I have provided a shortcut).
   You can use the OLite.ahk instead if you have installed AutoHotKey.

2. Place the "Game" folder inside of "Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta" and overwrite

3. Place the "570" folder inside of "Steam\userdata\ [Your 9 digit Steam ID here] " and overwrite

4. Restart your computer

5. launch DotA 2 and customize to your liking


Customization:
Project Oracle makes use of smart ordering of hotkeys for some heroes which have more than four abilities.
You can easily get rid of the ones you don't like in game by clicking the "clear" button for a particular hero.
The affected heroes are listed below:

1. Earth Spirit

2. IO

3. Lifestealer

4. Phoenix

5. Timbersaw

6. Lone Druid

7. Morphling

8. Spectre

9. Templar Assasin

10. Chen

11. Keeper of the Light

12. Ogre Magi

13. Puck

14. Rubick

15. Shadow Demon

16. Techies



Known Issues:

1. Self-cast abilities which are auto-castable are self-casted when the auto-cast hotkey is pressed.
Only affects Ogre Magi, Lich, and neutral troll priest. This is a Valve bug and out of my control.

2. The 13th and 14th items in shop panels don't have working hotkeys. This is also Valve's bug and out of my control.
